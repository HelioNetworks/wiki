# Repair Times

## All HelioHost Staff are Volunteers

[Helio Networks dba HelioHost](https://heliohost.org/) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization whose mission is to provide free or low cost web hosting, and all of our staff are volunteers. We all have full time jobs and lives outside of this project. We run this organization in our free time, and if we don't have very much free time things don't get done very quickly. 

## ETA for New Features and Server Repairs

Most for-profit hosting companies have a staff of full time employees who sit around providing support and working 40 hours a week. It's very rare for any of our volunteers to work more than an hour or so each day. None of our volunteers are required to log a certain number of hours and may come and go as they please. 

If we aren't having fun volunteering, providing support, chatting with the community, and developing new features then we take a break and do things that are more fun for us. This is why we don't have SLAs or ETAs for new features or repairs, and this is why things move a little slower than a for-profit company that you might be used to dealing with.
