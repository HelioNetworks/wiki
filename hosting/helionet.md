# What is HelioNet?

Helio Networks, or HelioNet, is a discussion board run by volunteers of the Helio community, founded in February of 2005 by [Ashoat Tesyovan](../misc/staff/ashoat.md) as a generic discussion board where anyone could discuss almost anything.

HelioNet created HelioHost, a free "Post to Host" web hosting service, that was available to its members, shortly after it was founded. HelioNet gradually became more focused on HelioHost, rather than a generic discussion board. Today, HelioNet is primarily a support site for HelioHost, and users are no longer required to sign up for HelioNet to get free hosting.

It has become one of the most active discusions on the Internet with 70,000+ registered members.

HelioNet is located at [https://helionet.org](https://helionet.org/index/).
