# What HelioHost is Not

HelioHost is a free web host; it is not your one-stop gateway to running a website. This article will explain exactly what HelioHost is NOT.

## HelioHost is NOT a Domain Registrar

A domain name registrar is a service used to purchase top level domains \(TLDs\) - i.e. a .com, .org, .net, or similar website name. HelioHost DOES NOT offer domain registration. When you sign up with HelioHost, you can use a free .heliohost.org subdomain \(your domain would be yourwebsite.heliohost.org where "yourwebsite" is replaced with whatever you choose\), use a domain purchased from another registrar \(such as [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/default.aspx) or [Network Solutions](http://www.networksolutions.com/)\), or a free .tk domain \(which you can register at [dot.tk](http://dot.tk/)\)\*. HelioHost does not offer, support, or maintain any domain names.

As a sign of thanks for HelioHost's most active members, HelioHost will purchase a domain for you with our own funds if you meet the requirements outlined [here](https://www.helionet.org/index/topic/34286-free-domain-requests-400-posts-required/).
{% endhint %}

## HelioHost is Not a Website Designer

HelioHost offers free website hosting. HelioHost does NOT create, design, or maintain your website for you, it only gives it a place to be hosted. Through cPanel, you can use Softaculous to install popular software \(such as blogging and forum platforms\) to your website, but you are responsible for ALL maintenance, design, etc.
