# What HelioHost is Not

HelioHost is a free web host; it is not your one-stop gateway to running a website. This article will explain exactly what HelioHost is NOT.

## HelioHost is NOT a Domain Registrar

A domain name registrar is a service used to purchase top level domains \(TLDs\) - i.e. a .com, .org, .net, or similar website name. HelioHost DOES NOT offer domain registration. When you sign up with HelioHost, you can use a free .heliohost.org subdomain \(your domain would be yourwebsite.heliohost.org where "yourwebsite" is replaced with whatever you choose\), use a domain purchased from another registrar \(such as [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/default.aspx) or [Network Solutions](http://www.networksolutions.com/)\), or a free domain \(which you can register at [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com/)\)\*. HelioHost does not offer, support, or maintain any domain names.

As a sign of thanks for HelioHost's most active members, HelioHost will purchase a domain for you with our own funds if you meet the requirements outlined [here](https://www.helionet.org/index/topic/34286-free-domain-requests-400-posts-required/).
{% endhint %}

## HelioHost is Not a Website Designer

HelioHost offers free website hosting. HelioHost does NOT create, design, or maintain your website for you, it only gives it a place to be hosted. Through Plesk, you can use their auto-installer to install popular software \(such as blogging and forum platforms\) to your website, but you are responsible for ALL maintenance, design, etc.
