# Charlie

Charlie is a physical server that HelioHost owns. He was purchased in 2010 and originally hosted [Cody](../virtual/cody.md) and [Johnny](../virtual/johnny.md). In 2016 when [Eddie](eddie.md) was purchased [Cody](../virtual/cody.md) was moved to [Eddie](eddie.md) so [Johnny](../virtual/johnny.md) could have all of the resources of Charlie to himself. When [Sparkie](sparkie.md) was purchased in 2019 [Johnny](../virtual/johnny.md) was moved off of Charlie as well.
