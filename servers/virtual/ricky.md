# Ricky

Ricky is meant to be a stable production server, after [Stevie](../physical/stevie.md) crashed due to disk failure. To maintain stability, he does not have as many services as Tommy or Johnny. Most notably Ricky is lacking Tomcat/Java, ASP.net, and Ruby on Rails. If you need to host a production site with advanced features, choose [Tommy](tommy.md).
