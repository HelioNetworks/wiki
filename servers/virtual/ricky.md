# Ricky

Ricky, our last cPanel server, was [powered off in July 2023](https://helionet.org/index/topic/56303-farewell-ricky/). 

We will eventually be rebuilding Ricky with Plesk. However, there is no estimated timeframe for this, since there are many other higher-priority projects to be completed first.

Once the rebuild is completed, an announcement will be posted in the HelioNet [News](https://helionet.org/index/forum/1-news/) section, as well as elsewhere on our site and our social media.
