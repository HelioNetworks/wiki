# Tommy

Tommy is one of our fastest and most stable servers, with its hardware being amongst the newest between our servers. Tommy has a high uptime of 100% and it cannot drop to anything lower than 99% uptime. Because of its stability and speed, it is recommended to anyone that needs a fast an stable production server. The only problem is that since Ricky closed \(for maintenance\) a lot of people decided to move to Tommy lowering its uptime to under 99% which is unacceptable. So they had to close the free signups. The only way to get into Tommy is to make a small donation of at least $1 and you will get a high quality Tommy server.
