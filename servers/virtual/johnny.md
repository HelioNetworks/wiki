# Johnny

Johnny is similar to Ricky, but he allows dangerous services such as Java/JSP to his users. Johnny is hosted on [Sparkie](../physical/sparkie.md). The difference between Johnny and Tommy is that Johnny is a Testing Server. Johnny has an average uptime of 99.39% but can drop to as low as 95%. Tommy however cannot drop to under 99% \(hence the strict suspension policies\).
