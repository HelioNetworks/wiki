# Morty

Morty is our flagship production server, available only to paid subscribers. Morty is the fastest server we have ever built, running on the fastest processor we have ever purchased, using the fastest SSD raid array we have ever had, and the fastest memory our processor supports. Thanks to 82 amazing donors during our 2023 fundraiser, we were able to raise enough money to purchase our newest server which is home to Morty, among other things. 

In November 2024, donors from our last fundraiser were transferred over to Morty and they spent a few weeks beta testing. The few issues found were fixed, and Morty was opened to account transfers from existing users in December 2024. 

The account move page in the dashboard is 100% automated, so if you decide to move to Morty you can do so without any help from an admin, and without even talking to anyone if you don't want to. That said, we would love to hear what you have to say about our new server if you decide to try it out, or if you have any feedback about the transfer process.

## No Login Requirement

Unlike our other shared hosting servers, Morty has no requirement to log in to your account every 30 days to keep it active. As long as there is a positive balance on your account, it will remain active.

## Pricing 

There will eventually be two ways to pay for Morty, the monthly subscription and the prepay option. Right now only the prepay option is available, but you can get $6 of Morty balance for only $5, which could keep your website online for 6 months. There is also the option to buy $12 balance and $24 balance for discounted rates. 

## Account Load Overage Charges

Keep in mind if your account uses more than 100 GB memory or 10k CPU in a day we will charge you an extra $0.0005 per 1 GB memory and $0.005 per 1k CPU rather than suspending you. So if you have a lot of overages the $6 balance won't last you a full 6 months, but we will email you when the balance gets low.
