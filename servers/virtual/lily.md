# Lily

Lily is a virtual server that runs Windows Server. She is mostly managed by [Wolstech](../../misc/staff/wolstech.md), a root admin.

## How to Request a Lily Account

<!-- TODO: Add Morty to the list below once released -->
To request an account on Lily, you must already have a Plesk account on Johnny or Tommy. Then, please create a new post in the [Customer Service forum](https://helionet.org/index/forum/45-customer-service/?do=add) to request that we create an account for you on Lily.

Please note that there is no control panel on Lily, and access is done via FTP. The eventual plan is to rebuild Lily to run Plesk as our other servers do. However there is [no estimated timeframe](../../hosting/repair-times.md) as to when this functionality may be implemented, since there are many other higher-priority projects to be completed first.
