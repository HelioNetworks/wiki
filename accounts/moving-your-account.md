# Moving your account

Whether you are on Johnny and want to move to Tommy or vice versa, follow these directions to switch servers.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you would like to preserve your existing account, donors can request that their account be moved directly without deletion. To do this, please [donate](https://www.heliohost.org/donate/).

After donating, please make a post in the [Customer Service forum](https://helionet.org/index/forum/45-customer-service/?do=add) with your **Transaction ID** and the **Username** of the account to be moved.
{% endhint %}

To move to another server without donating, refer to the following instructions:

1. Make a backup of all your files, databases, etc. ready for restoring \(as your current account will be deleted\).
2. [Request an account deletion.](https://heliohost.org/dashboard/delete/)
3. Wait for for your account to be deleted \(usually a few hours\).
4. [Sign up to HelioHost again.](https://www.heliohost.org/signup/) Make sure you choose the server you require.
5. Wait \([**up to 2 hours**](../hosting/signing-up.md#after-signup)\) for your new account to become active.
6. Restore your backups. \(Visit our tutorial page for guidance on [How to Extract Your Account Data from the Backup File](../tutorials/plesk/extract-backup-file.md).\)

ASP.NET requires an account on [Lily](../servers/virtual/lily.md). Please post in the [Customer Service forum](https://helionet.org/index/forum/45-customer-service/?do=add) to request that we set the account up for you.
