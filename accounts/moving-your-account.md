# Moving your account

Whether you are on Johnny and want to move to Ricky or Tommy or vice versa, follow these directions to switch servers.

Johnny offers services that Ricky does not \(Java/JSP\), but that also makes it much less stable. If you require those services, use Johnny or Tommy. If not, it is highly recommended that you use Tommy which is faster and more stable. If you need Ruby on Rails, then Tommy is currently the only choice.

If you would like to preserve your existing account, donors can request that their account be moved directly without deletion. To do this, please [donate](https://www.heliohost.org/donate/).

After donating, please make a post on the [customer service forum](https://www.helionet.org/index/forum/45-customer-service/) with your Transaction ID and the username of the account to be moved.
{% endhint %}

To move to another server without donating, refer to the following instructions:

1. Make a backup of all your files, databases, etc. ready for restoring \(as your current account will be deleted\).
2. [Request an account deletion.](http://www.heliohost.org/classic/support/scripts/delete)
3. Wait for for your account to be deleted \(usually a few hours\).
4. [Sign up to HelioHost again.](https://www.heliohost.org/signup/) Make sure you choose the server you require.
5. Wait for your new account to become active \(Johnny can take up to 24 hours, Ricky and Tommy activate within minutes\).
6. Restore your backups.

ASP.NET requires a request for an account on [Lily](../servers/virtual/lily.md). Please post on our [forums](https://www.helionet.org/index/forum/45-customer-service/) to request it. [Ruby on Rails](../tutorials/ror.md) is only available on Tommy.
