# Java / JSP

{% hint style="danger" %}
Java / JSP is not currently available on the free hosting service.
{% endhint %}

Support for Java was removed in 2021 when HelioHost switched to Plesk.

There is [no estimated timeframe](../hosting/repair-times.md) as to when Java support will be implemented again. 

Although it is on the roadmap, there are many other higher-priority projects to be completed first.

As soon as Java support returns, it will be announced in the HelioNet [News](https://helionet.org/index/forum/1-news/) section, as well as elsewhere on our site and our social media.  

## In the meantime, you will need a [VPS](https://heliohost.org/vps/) to run Java.

We offer a range of VPS plans, and a 10% discount when you pay for 6 months upfront.
