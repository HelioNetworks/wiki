# Softaculous

Softaculous is an auto-installer service which allows users to download and install software to assist in the creation of an amazing website \(such as a CMS, Forum, or Blog\). 

Softaculous is extremely similar to Fantastico, possibly even better.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Softaculous is not currently offered in Plesk, but it may be added in the next few months.

In the meantime, you can run the [free remote Softaculous](https://www.softaculous.com/remote/).

Alternatively, you can trial the service at [https://softaculous.com](https://softaculous.com/) where you can take a look at the description, reviews, support site, and a live demonstration.
