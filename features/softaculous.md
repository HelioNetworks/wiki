# Softaculous

Softaculous is an auto-installer service which allows users to download and install software to create all kinds of amazing websites (such as a CMS, Forum, or Blog). 

Softaculous is extremely similar to Fantastico, possibly even better.

Softaculous returned to Johnny and Tommy servers in [March 2024](https://helionet.org/index/topic/59683-softaculous-has-returned/), making it possible to install the latest version of 459 different software packages with just a single click.

To browse the available options, login to Plesk and select Softaculous from the menu:
