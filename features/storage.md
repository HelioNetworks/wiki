# Storage

## Free Accounts

HelioHost offers 1000 MB of web space with each of its free hosting accounts. This figure combines your stored files and your databases. This should be more than enough to handle any forum, blog, or other script you might need to host. Sites that might encounter problems with this limit include photo galleries with high-megapixel images or online storage sites. In general, this limit should not be a problem to the great majority of free hosting users.

## Non-free Upgrade Options

Sometimes, users wish to pay to increase their account capacity. We offer the following paid options:

### Donations for Additional Storage

For each $5 USD donated, users can [add 1000 MB extra space](../accounts/donation-increase-storage.md) to their account, up to a maximum account size of 6000 MB.

### Paid VPS Plans

For users who wish to pay for more memory or CPUs, we offer a range of [VPS plans](https://heliohost.org/vps/).
