# PHP

PHP is the most popular scripting language on the Internet for a reason. It's easy to learn and easy to implement, yet is powerful enough to suit almost every task. Unlike some other languages, PHP is not explicitly linked with any programming paradigms, allowing for more flexible development. HelioHost offers the latest version of PHP 5 on all its hosting accounts. We are unique in that we offer PHP without safe mode, which is the more secure but less functional alternative that you'll find on most free hosts.

## Learning PHP

`<?php` is the opening braces and `?>` is the closing braces for PHP.

Here is a sample hello world file.

```text
<?php echo "Hello World!";
```
