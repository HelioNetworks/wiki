## What is Plesk?

Plesk is a powerful, yet user-friendly hosting/domain manager. Plesk has a simple-to-use interface that makes editing your hosting details extremely easy.

## What can Plesk do?

Through Plesk (included with all HelioHost hosting accounts), you can:

* Create and manage e-mail addresses for your domain
* Check e-mail using RoundCube -or- alter MX records for use with another e-mail service (such as Google Workspace - doing this will cause the Plesk built-in webmail clients to stop working)
* Set-up e-mail clients for use with your e-mail addresses (through POP3/SMTP)
* Update your HelioHost account information/password
* Create and manage FTP accounts
* Use the built-in Plesk file manager
* Set-up FTP access using external FTP clients
* View error logs for your site
* Password protect directories on your site
* Manage zone records (A, CNAME, TXT) for your domain(s)
* Create MySQL/PostgreSQL databases/users (see [MySQL Databases](../management/mysql.md))
* Edit SQL tables using phpMyAdmin/phpPgAdmin
* Install software using Plesk Applications Installer
* Manage Perl modules

## How do I access my Plesk?

Plesk can be accessed by logging into the HelioHost website at [heliohost.org](https://heliohost.org/) or [heliohost.org/login](https://heliohost.org/login/) and clicking on the Plesk button.

{% hint style="info" %}
We strongly recommend that you **do not** bookmark your Plesk dashboard URL. Using the Plesk URL without first logging in at [heliohost.org](https://heliohost.org/) or [heliohost.org/login](https://heliohost.org/login/) will not track your logins and risks your account being [suspended for inactivity](https://wiki.helionet.org/accounts/suspension-policy#inactivity-policy) after 30 days.
