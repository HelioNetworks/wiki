## What is Plesk?

Plesk is a powerful, yet user-friendly hosting/domain manager. Plesk has a simple-to-use interface that makes editing your hosting details extremely easy.

## What can Plesk do?

Through Plesk \(included with all HelioHost hosting accounts\), you can:

* Create and manage e-mail addresses for your domain
* Check e-mail using RoundCube -or- alter MX records for use with another e-mail service \(such as Google Workspace - doing this will cause the Plesk built-in webmail clients to stop working\)
* Set-up e-mail clients for use with your e-mail addresses \(through POP3/SMTP\)
* Update your HelioHost account information/password
* Create and manage FTP accounts
* Use the built-in Plesk file manager
* Set-up FTP access using external FTP clients
* View error logs for your site
* Password protect directories on your site
* Manage zone records \(A, CNAME, TXT\) for your domain\(s\)
* Create MySQL/PostgreSQL databases/users \(see [MySQL Databases](../management/mysql.md)\)
* Edit SQL tables using phpMyAdmin/phpPgAdmin
* Install software using Plesk Applications Installer
* Manage Perl modules

## How do I access my Plesk?

Plesk can be accessed by logging into the HelioHost website, and then pressing the Plesk button.
