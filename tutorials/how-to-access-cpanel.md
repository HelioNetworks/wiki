## How to access cPanel <a id="firstHeading"></a>

cPanel is the vital control panel which you will manage your websites with. cPanel offers most of the services that you would require to make a great website, including a built in File Manager, Email, MySQL and more. But how do you access your personal cPanel?

### Access through Port 2083

The usual method of accessing your cPanel would be using Port 2083. To do this, simply navigate to [https://www.heliohost.org/login/](https://www.heliohost.org/login/) By logging in via that method, you know that you are logging in to a cPanel which is working 100%, as some other methods do not record your login attempts and therefore suspend you for inactivity. This method of logging in is the recommended way as it encrypts your password and all data you transfer to the server.

### Access through Port 80

Are you under the cover of a firewall which blocks Port 2083? No problem - simply access through the standard port: Port 80. To do this, simply click the "insecure login" button at the bottom of the page after logging in at [https://www.heliohost.org/login/](https://www.heliohost.org/login/) We highly recommend logging in to cPanel securely with encryption enabled. So only use Port 80 when you absolutely have no other way of connecting.

### Troubleshooting

If you cannot login to cPanel, then it is likely that your account was suspended for inactivity. Use the renew script [https://www.heliohost.org/renew/](https://www.heliohost.org/renew/) to reactivate your account.

If you have just created your account, then you may need to wait a little longer. Check your account status at: [https://www.heliohost.org/status/](https://www.heliohost.org/status/)

If that fails, you may have been suspended, or a strange problem may have happened. Please create a new topic at: [https://www.helionet.org/index/forum/81-suspended-and-queued-accounts/](https://www.helionet.org/index/forum/81-suspended-and-queued-accounts/)
