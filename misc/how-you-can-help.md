# How You Can Help

HelioHost provides community-powered free hosting for everyone. There are several ways you can help support us.

## Make a Donation

### Donate via PayPal or Crypto

The best way to help us keep providing free hosting is by donating at [https://heliohost.org/donate](https://heliohost.org/donate/). You can donate via PayPal or the cryptocurrencies listed on the page.

### Donate via Facebook 

In some countries, you can donate on the [HelioHost Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/HelioHost.org).

### Donate via Brave browser

HelioHost is a Verified Creator in the Brave Creators program. This means that if you use the Brave web browser, you can now donate to us by clicking the triangle shape while viewing [heliohost.org](https://heliohost.org/) or [helionet.org](https://helionet.org/) or Plesk, and then clicking Send Contribution. If you have auto-contribute enabled, you can donate to us simply by using our website and forum as you normally would.

If you're not familiar with the Brave browser, check out [https://privacytests.org](https://privacytests.org/). Brave is based on Chromium just like Chrome and Edge, but has a built in ad-blocker and annoyance blocker that is better than most extensions you can install on any of the other browsers. You can even get paid to visit websites if you enable the option in the settings and set up a crypto wallet.

#### Turn Brave Ad-Blocker Off

Using Brave's ad-blocker is a great way to support us with donations instead of viewing ads. However, as a non-profit fully funded by advertising revenue and donations, we appreciate you viewing our ads to help us stay in business. To double your donations from Brave, you can disable the Brave shields on our pages to view our ads, while also auto-contributing.

## Allow Ads on Our Sites
<!-- TODO: Add Ricky & Morty to the list of sites to allow ads on, as they get up and running. -->
If you don't view our ads, we don't earn any ad revenue from your visits to our site. It's free to allow our ads, and we promise they're not too annoying. Make sure to add `heliohost.org`, `helionet.org`, `tommy.heliohost.org`, `johnny.heliohost.org`, and `wiki.helionet.org` to your ad-blocker's 'Allow List'. Who knows? You might even see an ad for something amazing that you want to check out.

## Use Our Affiliate Links

HelioHost has an affiliate agreement with Namecheap, so if you're in the market for a new domain we highly recommend purchasing it from them. Once you set the nameservers to `ns1.heliohost.org` and `ns2.heliohost.org`, we can host the website on your brand new domain for you. Click the banner below to use our affiliate link to shop for your new domain:

After checking if your preferred domain name is available, there will sometimes be a Promo Code you can use at checkout, to get a very low price for the first year.
