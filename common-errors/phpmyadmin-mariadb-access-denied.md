Keep in mind if you change your password or your database user, you will need to update the config files of any applicable software.

For instance, if you're using WordPress (which [we don't recommend](../misc/wordpress.md)), you'll need to make sure that the database password in the `wp-config.php` file matches the password you enter into Plesk.
