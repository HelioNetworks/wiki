# Linux Case Sensitivity

Linux is case-sensitive when it comes to file and directory names. This means that `FileName.txt` and `filename.txt` are seen as completely different files, and `Images` and `images` are seen as completely different directories. 

Some operating systems (like Windows) are not case-sensitive, but capitalization matters when working with Linux-based systems.

If you're having trouble with file or directory names, please make sure the capitalization matches exactly between your local machine and your HelioHost account if you're on a Linux server.
