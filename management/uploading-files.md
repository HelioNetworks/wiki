# Uploading Files

## FTP / SFTP

Just one of the ways to upload and modify your website is through [FTP (File Transfer Protocol)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTP), which allows you to connect to your site and perform various file operations directly from your computer.

Once connected, you can perform the appropriate actions just as you would with any other file/folder on your computer. Simply drag and drop or copy and paste files to upload them. Right click on a file/folder to perform a variety of actions such as Rename, Delete, and Create Directory.

To connect to your site's FTP server, you will need to use an FTP Client, such as [FileZilla](http://filezilla-project.org/), which is completely free software used by millions across the world. The various settings you will need to connect to the servers are provided in the table below.

If you are having problems connecting to the FTP service, then it might be a temporary failure with the service due to high server load. You can retrieve real-time statistics on server load (including FTP service) at [https://status.heliohost.org](https://status.heliohost.org/)

You can manage your files with SFTP, or FTPS (on Port 21).  
We recommend not using FTP because it is insecure, but it's available too.
