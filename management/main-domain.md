# Changing Your Main Domain

To change your main domain \(the location of where your visitors will navigate to\), you will need to submit the main domain change form located below. However, before requesting to change your main domain, read up on [Parked, Addon and Sub Domains](parked-addon-and-sub-domains.md) as a useful automated alternative to changing your main domain. You can host as many domains as you want on your one hosting account so most of the time it's pointless to change your main domain when you can simply add the new domain as an alias.

If you have read up on Alias and Addon domains yet you prefer to change your main domain, then submit a request at [http://heliohost.org/home/support/scripts/domain](http://heliohost.org/home/support/scripts/domain).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure the domain you're changing to isn't already added to cPanel as an Alias or an Addon domain. Otherwise, the main domain change will fail.
{% endhint %}

Depending on the server because of the Apache service, the main domain change might take between a few seconds and a few days, up to 48 hours.

You will need to point your new domain to the following nameservers:

`ns1.heliohost.org` and `ns2.heliohost.org`
